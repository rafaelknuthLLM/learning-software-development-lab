# Scenario 1: Requirements Analysis with Prompt Engineering

## Overview
Using your actual software development learning journey as the real-world scenario to learn prompt engineering and evaluation. This combines SDLC Requirements Analysis phase with hands-on Claude Code practice.

## Objectives
- Learn prompt engineering by solving your actual problem (gathering learning requirements)
- Build evaluation framework to measure prompt effectiveness with real data
- Create working system for clarifying software development learning needs
- Apply top-down methodology through code and systematic testing

## Approach
Following your learning methodology:
- Top-down: Start with big picture learning goals â†’ drill down to specific daily needs
- Use agentic tools for systematic exploration of requirements
- Build and test immediately, iterate based on performance data
- Document discoveries for community sharing

## Working Files
- `requirements_analysis_prompts.ipynb` - Main prompt engineering and testing
- `requirements_evaluation.ipynb` - Evaluation framework and metrics
- `data/` - Test cases, evaluation results, performance data

## Success Criteria
By end of session:
- [ ] Working notebook that gathers your learning requirements effectively
- [ ] Evaluation system that measures prompt quality with data
- [ ] Test results showing which prompt versions work best
- [ ] Refined prompts ready for actual use in your learning journey

## Learning Integration
This scenario uses:
- **Prompt Engineering course** - for systematic prompt design
- **Prompt Evaluations course** - for building testing framework
- **Your documented methodology** - top-down, build-first, iterate fast
- **Real-world application** - your actual career transition needs
