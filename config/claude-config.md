# Learning Software Development Lab

## Project Overview
I'm learning software development by exploring Anthropic's real codebase like a new team member. I use Claude Code to discover how they actually build, test, and deploy software, following SDLC and DevOps best practices.

## Commands
**Exploration:**
- `git clone [repo-url]` - Clone Anthropic repositories for analysis
- `git log --oneline -10` - Check recent commits and patterns

**Development:**
- Commit frequently: `git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push`
- Always validate before moving to next step

## Learning Approach
- Explore real codebases, not artificial tutorials
- Learn by building and contributing to Anthropic's community
- Work in public - document and share all discoveries
- Use systematic exploration: README → Structure → Code → Patterns
- Validate findings with community feedback
- Apply course skills (API, prompting, evaluation, tools) to real discovery

## Development Standards
- Build in small, testable increments with validation checkpoints
- Each discovery must have measurable quality gates (80% coverage, 90% accuracy)
- Always get community validation before claiming completion
- Document everything for future team members to follow
- Create shareable tools and insights, not just personal learning
- Update documentation with each increment

## Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Validation:** Verify discoveries against official Anthropic documentation
- **Community Review:** Share findings with Anthropic community for feedback
- **Measurable Gates:** Each scenario has specific completion criteria
- **Documentation:** Follow standardized templates for knowledge sharing
- **Iteration:** Update approach based on learnings and community input

## Code Style Preferences
- Simple, readable code over complex solutions
- Extensive comments explaining discovery process
- Real-world examples from actual Anthropic codebase
- Focus on practical application, not theoretical concepts

## File Organization
- **config/claude-config.md:** Instructions for Claude Code sessions (this file)
- **scenario-based-learning/:** My 6 SDLC discovery scenarios
- **logs/daily/:** Session summaries and discoveries
- **anthropic-courses/:** Anthropic's training materials I studied
- **anthropic-cookbook/:** Examples and guides I'm exploring
- **scripts/:** Session management and automation tools
- **docs/:** Project documentation and context

## Current Focus
Real-world codebase discovery: Learn SDLC by systematically exploring how Anthropic builds software.

**Goal:** Master software development through hands-on discovery of Anthropic's practices while contributing valuable tools and insights back to their community.

**Status:** Working on Scenario 1 (Requirements Discovery) - systematically analyzing Anthropic's ecosystem to understand what problems their code solves.
