**What we'll build:** A simple task management application
**Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js, basic HTML/CSS
**Skills learned:**
- Claude-Flow agent coordination
- SPARC methodology
- Test-driven development
- Multi-agent collaboration

**Time required:** 45-60 minutes

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup 🚀

### 1.1 Create Project Directory

```bash
# Navigate to your projects folder
cd ~/claude-flow-projects

# Create new project
mkdir task-manager-app
cd task-manager-app

# Initialize Claude-Flow project
npx claude-flow init
```

**Follow the prompts:**
- Project name: `task-manager-app`
- Description: `A simple task management app built with Claude-Flow`
- Template: `nodejs`
- Initialize git: `Y`
- Install dependencies: `Y`

### 1.2 Verify Project Structure

```bash
# Check created files
ls -la

# Should see:
# package.json
# .claude-flow/
# src/
# tests/
# .gitignore
# README.md
```

---

## Phase 2: Plan with Agent Coordination 🎯

### 2.1 Start Claude Desktop and Plan the Project

Open Claude Desktop and start a new conversation. Use this exact prompt:

```
I want to build a simple task management web application. Please coordinate multiple agents to help me plan and build this project using Claude-Flow methodology.

Requirements:
- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Basic web interface
- File-based storage (JSON)
- Express.js backend
- Simple HTML frontend

Please initialize a swarm and coordinate the following agents:
1. A researcher to analyze requirements and best practices
2. An architect to design the system structure
3. A planner to break down tasks

Project location: ~/claude-flow-projects/task-manager-app

Use SPARC methodology and coordinate via hooks.
```

**Expected result:** Claude should initialize a swarm and coordinate multiple agents to plan your project.

### 2.2 Review Generated Plan

After Claude completes the planning phase, you should have:
- Detailed requirements analysis
- System architecture design
- Task breakdown structure
- Implementation roadmap

---

## Phase 3: SPARC Development Process 📋

### 3.1 Specification Phase

**In Claude Desktop, request:**

```
Now let's move to the Specification phase. Please have the researcher agent create detailed specifications for our task management app, including:

1. User stories and acceptance criteria
2. API endpoint specifications
3. Data model design
4. User interface mockups (text-based)

Save all specifications to the docs/ directory and coordinate with other agents via hooks.
```

### 3.2 Pseudocode Phase

**Request in Claude Desktop:**

```
Move to Pseudocode phase. Please coordinate agents to create pseudocode for:

1. Task CRUD operations
2. Express.js server setup
3. File-based data persistence
4. Basic HTML interface logic

Use the hooks system to share pseudocode between agents.
```

### 3.3 Architecture Phase

**Request in Claude Desktop:**

```
Now Architecture phase. Please have agents design:

1. Directory structure and file organization
2. Module dependencies and relationships
3. API routing structure
4. Data flow diagrams
5. Error handling strategy

Create architecture documents and coordinate via memory system.
```

---

## Phase 4: Implementation with TDD 🔧

### 4.1 Start Test-Driven Development

**In Claude Desktop:**

```
Begin the implementation phase using Test-Driven Development. Please coordinate agents to:

1. Spawn a tester agent to write comprehensive tests first
2. Spawn a coder agent to implement code that passes the tests
3. Spawn a reviewer agent to ensure code quality

Start with the core Task model and basic CRUD operations.
Use hooks for coordination between agents.
```

### 4.2 Implement Core Components

The agents should create:

**Backend Components:**
- `src/models/Task.js` - Task data model
- `src/routes/tasks.js` - Express routes for task operations
- `src/utils/dataStore.js` - File-based data persistence
- `src/server.js` - Main Express server

**Frontend Components:**
- `public/index.html` - Main interface
- `public/styles.css` - Basic styling
- `public/script.js` - Client-side JavaScript

**Tests:**
- `tests/task.test.js` - Unit tests for Task model
- `tests/routes.test.js` - API endpoint tests
- `tests/integration.test.js` - End-to-end tests

### 4.3 Monitor Agent Coordination

Watch for coordination messages:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, monitor coordination
npx claude-flow logs --follow --level info
```

You should see agents communicating via hooks and sharing information.

---

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement ✅

### 4.1 Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- task.test.js
```

### 4.2 Manual Testing

**Start the server:**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or start production server
npm start
```

**Test in browser:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try adding a task
3. Try editing a task
4. Try deleting a task
5. Try marking tasks complete/incomplete

### 4.3 Agent-Coordinated Testing

**In Claude Desktop:**

```
Please coordinate agents to perform comprehensive testing:

1. Have the tester agent run all automated tests and report results
2. Have a reviewer agent perform code review and suggest improvements
3. Have a performance agent analyze the application for optimization opportunities

Report all findings via hooks and memory system.
```

---

## Phase 6: Review and Documentation 📚

### 6.1 Code Review Session

**Request in Claude Desktop:**

```
Coordinate a comprehensive code review session:

1. Review agent should analyze code quality, patterns, and best practices
2. Security agent should check for vulnerabilities
3. Performance agent should identify optimization opportunities
4. Documentation agent should ensure adequate documentation

Provide improvement recommendations and coordinate fixes.
```

### 6.2 Generated Documentation

Agents should have created:
- API documentation
- Code comments
- User guide
- Deployment instructions

### 6.3 Performance Analysis

**Check performance metrics:**

```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Run performance benchmarks
npx claude-flow benchmark run --type performance

# Check memory usage
npx claude-flow memory usage --detail
```

---

## Phase 7: Deployment Preparation 🚀

### 7.1 Production Readiness

**Request in Claude Desktop:**

```
Prepare the application for production deployment:

1. DevOps agent should create Docker configuration
2. Security agent should implement production security measures
3. Performance agent should optimize for production
4. Documentation agent should create deployment guide

Coordinate all changes via hooks system.
```

### 7.2 Environment Configuration

The agents should create:
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service setup
- `package.json` scripts for production

### 7.3 Final Testing

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build
NODE_ENV=production npm start

# Run all tests in production mode
NODE_ENV=production npm test
```

---

## Understanding Agent Coordination 🤝

### 7.1 Monitor Agent Communication

During the project, observe how agents coordinate:

```bash
# Watch coordination logs
npx claude-flow logs --filter coordination

# Check memory sharing
npx claude-flow memory list --namespace project

# View agent status
npx claude-flow swarm status
```

### 7.2 Coordination Patterns You'll See

**Pre-task coordination:**
- Agents announce their tasks
- Share context via memory
- Request information from other agents

**During-task coordination:**
- Progress updates
- File change notifications
- Dependency completions

**Post-task coordination:**
- Result sharing
- Next task preparation
- Quality checks
