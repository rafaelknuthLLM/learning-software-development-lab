## Key Architecture Decisions

### Experience-First Design
- **Adaptive Interface**: UI complexity adjusts based on user experience level
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Advanced features unlock as users gain confidence
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured SPARC phases based on experience and project type

### SPARC Framework Integration
- **Modular Phases**: Each SPARC phase can be enabled/disabled independently
- **Coordinated Execution**: Claude-Flow agents work together across phases
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress and can intervene at any phase

### Scalability & Performance
- **Stateless API Design**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Queue-based Processing**: Handle high loads with background task processing
- **Shared Memory**: Redis-based coordination for multi-instance deployments
- **WebSocket Updates**: Real-time progress without polling overhead

### Accessibility & Usability
- **WCAG Compliance**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed to avoid overwhelming beginners
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent design patterns throughout the application
- **Error Prevention**: Validation and guidance to prevent common mistakes

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for component-based UI
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **CSS Modules** with design system for consistent styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js for API server
- **WebSocket** server for real-time communication
- **SQLite** for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Redis** for caching and coordination

### Integration
- **Claude-Flow** for agent orchestration and SPARC execution
- **Coordination Hooks** for seamless integration
- **Shared Memory** for agent communication

## Development Approach

This architecture follows the **SPARC methodology** itself:

1. **Specification**: Clear requirements based on user research
2. **Pseudocode**: Logical flow diagrams and component interactions
3. **Architecture**: System design with scalability and maintainability
4. **Refinement**: Component breakdown with implementation details
5. **Completion**: Integration points and deployment considerations

The design prioritizes **beginner accessibility** while maintaining the power and flexibility of the Claude-Flow framework for more experienced users.
