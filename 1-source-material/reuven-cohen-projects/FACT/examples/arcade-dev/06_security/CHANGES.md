# Security Example - Changes and Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` Usage
**Problem**: The code was using `datetime.utcnow()` which is deprecated in Python 3.12+
**Fix**: Replaced all instances with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for timezone-aware datetime objects

**Files Modified**:
- `secure_tool_execution.py`: Fixed 3 instances
- `README.md`: Fixed 1 instance in code example

**Specific Changes**:
1. Line 96: Changed `default_factory=datetime.utcnow` to `default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
2. Lines 370-371: Changed `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in session creation
3. README.md line 71: Updated documentation example to use modern datetime syntax

### 2. Demo Mode Implementation
**Status**: Already properly implemented
- The example includes robust demo mode functionality when API credentials are not available
- Mock implementations demonstrate all security features without requiring real API keys
- Clear logging indicates when running in demo mode

### 3. Error Handling
**Status**: Comprehensive error handling already in place
- Input validation with proper sanitization
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing
- Detailed audit logging for all operations
- Rate limiting and permission checking

### 4. Security Best Practices
**Status**: All best practices implemented
- Secure credential storage with encryption
- Session management with expiration
- Input sanitization and validation
- Audit logging for all operations
- Rate limiting and IP whitelisting
- Permission-based access control

## Testing Results

âœ… **All tests passed successfully**
- No deprecation warnings
- Demo mode works correctly
- All security features demonstrate properly
- Error handling is robust
- Code follows Python best practices

## Summary

The security example now runs cleanly without any deprecation warnings and demonstrates comprehensive security practices including:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: User registration, login, and permission management
2. **Secure Session Management**: Token-based sessions with expiration
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all inputs
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
6. **Demo Mode**: Full functionality demonstration without requiring real credentials

The example serves as an excellent reference for implementing security best practices in Arcade.dev integrations.
