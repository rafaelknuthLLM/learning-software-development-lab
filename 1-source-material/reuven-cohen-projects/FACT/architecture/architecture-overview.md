# FACT System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The FACT (Fast-Access Cached Tools) system is designed to provide deterministic answers with fresh data and sub-100ms latency by implementing a lean retrieval pattern that skips vector search through token caching in Claude Sonnet-4 and fetching live facts via authenticated tools hosted on Arcade.dev.

This document provides an overview of the architecture design and guides readers through the detailed architecture documentation.

## Architecture Principles

The FACT system architecture is built on four core principles:

1. **Performance-First Design**: All architectural decisions prioritize achieving sub-100ms response times and minimizing resource usage.

2. **Deterministic Responses**: The system must provide consistent, reliable answers given the same inputs.

3. **Security-First Approach**: Security is built into every layer of the system, not added as an afterthought.

4. **Modular Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces between components.

## Key Components

The FACT system consists of six primary subsystems:

1. **FACT Driver**: The central orchestrator that manages query processing, cache control, and tool execution.

2. **Cache Management System**: Handles token caching strategies, metrics, and optimization to achieve ≤50ms latency on cache hits.

3. **Tool Management System**: Manages tool registration, discovery, schema generation, and execution.

4. **Arcade Integration Layer**: Provides a secure interface to the Arcade.dev gateway for tool hosting and execution.

5. **Security System**: Implements authentication, authorization, input validation, and audit logging.

6. **Data Access Layer**: Manages connections to databases and external data sources.

## Architecture Documents

The architecture is documented through the following files:

1. [**Folder Structure**](./folder-structure.md): Defines the organizational structure of the codebase with clear separation of concerns.

2. [**Component Diagrams**](./component-diagram.md): Visualizes the relationships between system components and their responsibilities.

3. [**Data Flow Architecture**](./data-flow.md): Illustrates how data moves through the system during key operations.

4. [**Implementation Guidelines**](./implementation-guidelines.md): Provides specific guidance on implementing each component to meet requirements.

## Performance Architecture

The FACT system is designed to meet strict performance requirements:

- **Cache Hit Path**: ≤50ms end-to-end latency
- **Cache Miss Path**: ≤140ms end-to-end latency
- **Tool Execution**: ≤10ms for LAN-based tools

Performance is achieved through:

1. **Efficient Caching**: Using Claude Sonnet-4's cache_control mechanism with ≥500 token cache prefixes
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking I/O throughout the system
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reusing connections to external services
4. **Minimal Data Transfer**: Optimizing message sizes and serialization
5. **Memory Management**: Careful object lifecycle management

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented through multiple layers:

1. **Authentication**: API key management and OAuth integration
2. **Authorization**: Scope-based access control for tools
3. **Input Validation**: Schema-based validation for all inputs
4. **Output Sanitization**: Preventing information disclosure
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## Scalability Architecture

The system is designed to scale horizontally:

1. **Stateless Design**: Core components maintain minimal state
2. **Load Balancing**: Multiple driver instances can operate behind load balancers
3. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
4. **Portable Cache Prefixes**: Cache can be shared across instances
5. **Independent Components**: Clear boundaries enable separate scaling

## Implementation Roadmap

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Foundation Phase** (Weeks 1-2): Core infrastructure and basic components
2. **Tool Integration Phase** (Weeks 3-4): Tool framework and SQL implementation
3. **Cache Optimization Phase** (Weeks 5-6): Advanced caching and performance tuning
4. **Security & Authorization Phase** (Weeks 7-8): Security hardening and OAuth integration
5. **Testing & Validation Phase** (Weeks 9-10): Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
6. **Deployment & Monitoring Phase** (Weeks 11-12): Production deployment and monitoring

## Architecture Decisions

The following key architecture decisions shape the FACT system:

1. **Cache-First Query Processing**: Prioritize cache hits for performance, falling back to tool execution only when necessary.

2. **Asynchronous Component Design**: All components use async/await patterns to maximize throughput and minimize latency.

3. **Tool Schema Generation**: Tool schemas are automatically generated from Python decorators, ensuring consistency between implementation and API.

4. **Sandbox Tool Execution**: Tools run in a sandboxed environment through Arcade.dev to maintain security.

5. **Metric-Driven Optimization**: Comprehensive metrics collection enables data-driven performance tuning.

6. **Defense-in-Depth Security**: Multiple layers of security controls protect against various threat vectors.

## Conclusion

The FACT system architecture provides a solid foundation for achieving the core requirements of sub-100ms response times, deterministic answers, and security-first design. By following the modular design principles and implementation guidelines, the system will deliver a high-performance, secure solution for fast data access.
