## Implementation Details

### Core Components Architecture

#### 1. Circuit Breaker Implementation ([`src/cache/resilience.py`](src/cache/resilience.py:1))

**[`CacheCircuitBreaker`](src/cache/resilience.py:88)** - Central circuit breaker implementation
- **State Management**: Automatic transitions between CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN states
- **Failure Detection**: Configurable failure thresholds and rolling window analysis
- **Recovery Logic**: Gradual recovery with configurable success thresholds
- **Thread Safety**: Full thread-safe operation with `threading.RLock`
- **Health Monitoring**: Background health checking during OPEN state

**Key Features**:
```python
class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation - cache is working
    OPEN = "open"          # Cache is down - all operations fail fast
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"  # Testing if cache is back - limited operations
```

**Configuration Options**:
- `failure_threshold`: Number of failures to open circuit (default: 5)
- `success_threshold`: Number of successes to close circuit (default: 3)
- `timeout_seconds`: Time to wait before trying half-open (default: 60.0)
- `rolling_window_seconds`: Rolling window for failure rate calculation (default: 300.0)
- `gradual_recovery`: Enable gradual recovery mode (default: True)
- `recovery_factor`: Fraction of requests during recovery (default: 0.5)

#### 2. Resilient Cache Wrapper ([`src/cache/resilience.py`](src/cache/resilience.py:427))

**[`ResilientCacheWrapper`](src/cache/resilience.py:427)** - Production-ready cache wrapper
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Wraps all cache operations with circuit breaker protection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Configurable fallback responses for each operation type
- **Metrics Collection**: Combined metrics from cache and circuit breaker systems
- **Transparent Operation**: Drop-in replacement for standard cache manager

**Fallback Behaviors**:
```python
fallback_responses = {
    "store": True,     # Pretend store succeeded
    "get": None,       # Return cache miss
    "invalidate": 0    # Return 0 invalidated entries
}
```

#### 3. Integration with FACT Driver ([`src/core/driver.py`](src/core/driver.py:50))

**Graceful Degradation in Core System**:
- **Cache-First Pattern**: Attempts cache operations first with circuit breaker protection
- **Transparent Fallback**: Continues with LLM processing when cache is unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error classification and graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks cache hit/miss rates and circuit breaker state

**Implementation in [`process_query()`](src/core/driver.py:115)**:
```python
# Step 1: Check cache with resilience
if self.resilient_cache:
    query_hash = self.resilient_cache.generate_hash(user_input)
    cache_entry = await self.resilient_cache.get(query_hash)
    if cache_entry:
        cached_response = cache_entry.content
```

### System Architecture and Design Decisions

#### Circuit Breaker State Machine
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CLOSED
    CLOSED --> OPEN : failure_threshold exceeded
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN : timeout_seconds elapsed
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED : success_threshold reached
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN : any failure
```

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: Circuit breaker immediately rejects requests when OPEN
2. **Gradual Recovery**: HALF_OPEN state allows controlled testing of cache recovery
3. **Thread Safety**: All operations protected with re-entrant locks
4. **Metrics-Driven**: Decisions based on real-time failure rates and performance data
5. **Configuration-Driven**: All thresholds and timeouts externally configurable

#### Component Interactions
- **FACTDriver** ↔ **ResilientCacheWrapper** ↔ **CacheCircuitBreaker** ↔ **CacheManager**
- **Metrics Collection** ← All components provide telemetry
- **Health Monitoring** ← Background monitoring of circuit breaker state
- **Error Classification** ← Structured error handling with graceful degradation
