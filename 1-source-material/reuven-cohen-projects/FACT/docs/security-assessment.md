# FACT System Security Assessment

## Executive Summary

This security assessment identifies critical vulnerabilities across multiple components of the FACT system. The review covers input validation, SQL injection prevention, authentication/authorization, cache security, rate limiting, API key management, and error handling.

## Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate security risk requiring urgent remediation
- **HIGH**: Significant security weakness requiring prompt attention
- **MEDIUM**: Security improvement recommended
- **LOW**: Best practice enhancement

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. Authentication & Authorization (CRITICAL)
**Issues:**
- In-memory storage of authorization tokens (line 102 in `src/security/auth.py`)
- Demo tokens with predictable patterns (line 301 in `src/security/auth.py`)
- No OAuth client secret validation during initialization
- Missing token encryption/hashing
- No session invalidation on logout

**Impact:** Full system compromise through token manipulation or replay attacks

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention (HIGH)
**Issues:**
- String concatenation in schema queries (line 206 in `src/db/connection.py`)
- PRAGMA queries vulnerable to injection (line 206 in `src/tools/connectors/sql.py`)
- Insufficient parameterized query usage
- Basic keyword filtering can be bypassed

**Impact:** Potential database compromise and data exfiltration

### 3. Input Validation (HIGH)
**Issues:**
- Regex patterns allow bypass of dangerous content (lines 354-361 in `src/tools/validation.py`)
- Insufficient URL validation allowing SSRF attacks
- Large payload DoS vulnerability (10MB+ strings allowed)
- Missing input sanitization for XSS prevention

**Impact:** Server-side request forgery, denial of service, code injection

### 4. Cache Security (MEDIUM)
**Issues:**
- No encryption of cached sensitive data
- Cache invalidation accessible without authentication
- Potential information leakage through cache timing attacks
- Missing cache entry access controls

**Impact:** Sensitive data exposure and cache poisoning attacks

### 5. Rate Limiting (HIGH)
**Issues:**
- Global rate limiting instead of per-user (lines 95-112 in `src/tools/executor.py`)
- No distributed rate limiting for clustered deployments
- Rate limits can be bypassed through multiple sessions
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts

**Impact:** Denial of service and brute force attacks

### 6. API Key Management (CRITICAL)
**Issues:**
- API keys stored in plain text in memory
- No key rotation mechanism
- Missing key validation and sanitization
- API keys potentially logged in debug mode

**Impact:** Complete API access compromise

### 7. Error Handling (MEDIUM)
**Issues:**
- Stack traces exposed in error responses
- Detailed error messages reveal system internals
- No error response sanitization
- Database errors expose schema information

**Impact:** Information disclosure aiding targeted attacks

### 8. Network Security (HIGH)
**Issues:**
- SSRF protection insufficient (lines 322-377 in `src/tools/connectors/http.py`)
- Missing TLS certificate validation
- No network timeout enforcement
- Private IP range detection incomplete

**Impact:** Internal network access and data exfiltration

## Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)
1. Implement secure token storage with encryption
2. Add proper OAuth client secret validation
3. Implement secure session management
4. Encrypt sensitive cache data
5. Sanitize all error responses

### Short-term Actions (HIGH)
1. Implement parameterized queries for all database operations
2. Add comprehensive input sanitization
3. Implement per-user rate limiting
4. Strengthen SSRF protection
5. Add API key encryption and rotation

### Medium-term Actions (MEDIUM)
1. Implement cache access controls
2. Add comprehensive security logging
3. Implement security headers
4. Add content security policy
5. Implement input/output encoding

## Security Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Secure Coding Standards
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Apply principle of least privilege

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure token generation and storage
- Apply role-based access control
- Implement proper logout procedures

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper key management
- Apply data classification standards
- Implement secure backup procedures

### 4. Network Security
- Implement comprehensive SSRF protection
- Use TLS for all communications
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Apply network segmentation

## Compliance Considerations

### OWASP Top 10 Alignment
- A1: Broken Access Control - Partially addressed
- A2: Cryptographic Failures - Not addressed
- A3: Injection - Partially addressed
- A4: Insecure Design - Requires improvement
- A5: Security Misconfiguration - Requires improvement

### Data Protection
- Implement data classification
- Apply appropriate encryption standards
- Implement audit logging
- Apply data retention policies

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize CRITICAL vulnerabilities for immediate remediation
2. Implement security fixes in a phased approach
3. Conduct security testing after each fix
4. Implement continuous security monitoring
5. Schedule regular security assessments
