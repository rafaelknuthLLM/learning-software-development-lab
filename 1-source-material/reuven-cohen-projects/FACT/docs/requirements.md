# FACT System Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

**System Name**: FACT (Fast-Access Cached Tools)  
**Purpose**: A lean retrieval pattern that skips vector search by caching static tokens in Claude Sonnet-4 and fetching live facts through authenticated tools hosted on Arcade.dev  
**Goals**: Achieve deterministic answers, fresh data, and sub-100ms latency

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core System Requirements (Must-Have)

#### FR-001: Cache Management
- System MUST implement token caching using Claude Sonnet-4's cache_control mechanism

- System MUST reduce token costs by up to 90% on cache hits

#### FR-002: Tool Integration
- System MUST integrate with Arcade.dev gateway for tool execution
- System MUST support dynamic tool registration and discovery
- System MUST forward structured tool calls from Claude to Arcade
- System MUST handle tool authentication and authorization flows

#### FR-003: Query Processing
- System MUST accept natural language queries with placeholders (e.g., "{lookup sql}")
- System MUST generate structured tool calls based on query intent
- System MUST append tool results as tool messages for completion
- System MUST provide deterministic responses based on structured data

#### FR-004: Database Operations
- System MUST support read-only SQL queries through tools

- Cache hit responses: ≤50ms
- Cache miss responses: ≤140ms
- Tool call execution: ≤10ms (LAN)
- Overall system response: ≤100ms average

#### PR-002: Cost Optimization
- Achieve 90% cost reduction on cache hits vs traditional RAG
- Maintain 65% cost reduction on cache misses vs traditional RAG
- Support token-efficient caching strategies

### 2.3 Scalability Requirements (Nice-to-Have)

#### SR-001: Multi-Instance Support
- System SHOULD support multiple driver instances
- System SHOULD enable portable cache prefixes across instances
- System SHOULD support horizontal scaling behind load balancers

#### SR-002: Tool Ecosystem
- System SHOULD support easy addition of new tools via decorators
- System SHOULD enable tool discovery and schema export
- System SHOULD support tool versioning and updates
