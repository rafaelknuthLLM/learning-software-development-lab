# Running the Claude-Flow Development Environment: A Step-by-Step Guide for Absolute Beginners

**Body:**

Claude-Flow is a local, command-line framework designed to orchestrate specialized AI agents that assist in software development. Getting it started requires a different approach than a typical application. This guide provides the direct commands to get it running and understand its purpose.

**1. Understand the Core Concept: The Hive Model**

Before running commands, it helps to know the system's "Hive Mind" operating model:

*   **The Hive:** The entire project environment. It contains the source code, configuration, and a shared memory for the AI agents to coordinate.
*   **Worker Agents:** A library of over 50 specialized AIs, each with a single, distinct skill. This includes agents like `Specification Writer`, `Coder`, `Tester`, `Database Architect`, and `Security Reviewer`.
*   **The Orchestrator:** The `claude-flow` tool itself. It acts as a project manager, interpreting your command and dispatches the correct agent or team of agents (a "swarm") for the task.

You don't run a server in the traditional sense; you give high-level orders to the orchestrator.

**2. The 3-Step Quick Start Guide**

These three commands configure the environment and verify it's working.

*   **Step 1: Install the Global Tool**
    This gives you access to the main `claude` command from anywhere on your system.
    ```
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    ```

*   **Step 2: Register the Local Project**
    This tells the main `claude` tool that this specific folder contains a Claude-Flow project it can control.
    ```
    claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
    ```
    *(Note: If it says "already exists," this step is already complete).*

*   **Step 3: Verify the System**
    This command asks the orchestrator to list all available worker agents. A successful output is a list of modes like `Architect`, `Tester`, and `Supabase Admin`.
    ```
    npx claude-flow sparc modes
    ```

**3. Example Task: Designing a "Contact Us" Form**

To see it perform a task, we used the `spec-pseudocode` mode.

*   **The Command:**
    ```
    npx claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create a 'Contact Us' form with Name, Email, and Message fields."
    ```

*   **The Result:**
    The orchestrator dispatched a `Specification Writer` agent. This agent's job is to create a plan, not application code. It produced two detailed documents:
    1.  **A Requirements Specification:** This file defined the functional requirements (e.g., "Name field must be 2-50 characters"), technical requirements (e.g., "must work on Chrome and Firefox"), and UI/UX considerations.
    2.  **A Pseudocode Plan:** This file laid out the step-by-step logic for a programmer. It included algorithms for handling user input, validating fields, and managing the form's state, all written in a simple, readable format.

This workflow shows that Claude-Flow is a tool focused heavily on the architectural and planning stages of software development. It uses AI to structure a project and create clear blueprints *before* code is written, aiming to improve quality and reduce errors.
