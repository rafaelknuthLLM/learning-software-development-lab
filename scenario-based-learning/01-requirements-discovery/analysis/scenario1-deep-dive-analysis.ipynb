This notebook provides systematic analysis using Data Analyst rigor.\n\n### What We Discovered in Scenario 1\n\n- 46% of Anthropic's ecosystem addresses developer onboarding challenges\n- 6 core user requirement categories identified\n- \"The Learning Crisis\" - nearly half focused on developer education\n- Production Gap - only 20% on production patterns\n\n### Our Working Hypotheses\n\n**Hypothesis 1:** The high onboarding percentage (46%) indicates that getting started with Anthropic's tools involves many discrete challenges that are best addressed through separate, focused examples rather than monolithic documentation.\n\n**Hypothesis 2:** The education-heavy distribution suggests Anthropic's technology has broad applicability across many use cases, each requiring its own examples and patterns to demonstrate effectively.\n\n**Hypothesis 3:** The production gap (only 20% of files) might be appropriate if most users are still in experimental phases rather than deploying to production, OR if production needs are well-served by fewer, more comprehensive files."
