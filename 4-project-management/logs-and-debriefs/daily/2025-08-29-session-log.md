# Session Log: August 29, 2025 - Session Starter Script Remediation

## Session Summary

The session began with the objective of continuing work on "Scenario 1: Requirements Discovery." However, upon running the `1-session-starter.py` script, we immediately identified a critical issue. The script incorrectly reported that "No previous progress detected," failing to recognize the significant prior analysis of the `CLAUDE-FLOW` project.

This discovery necessitated a pivot from our original plan. To ensure the stability and accuracy of future sessions, we decided that fixing the starter script was the immediate priority. We diagnosed that the script's method for detecting progress—by searching for keywords in the most recent log file—was unreliable. We formulated a more robust strategy: the script should instead check for the existence of files within a scenario's dedicated `analysis` and `deliverables` directories.

Following this new strategy, we executed a three-stage remediation of the script. First, we examined the source code to confirm the location of the flawed logic. Second, we replaced the faulty `detect_current_progress` function with a new implementation that performs the directory check. Third, we made necessary adjustments to the `main` and `generate_context_prompt` functions to integrate the new logic.

To conclude the task, we ran the modified script to verify the fix. It performed as expected, correctly identifying that Scenario 1 was in progress and listing the relevant files.

## Outcome

As a result of this work, the `1-session-starter.py` script is now significantly more reliable. It can accurately differentiate between a new and an in-progress scenario. This crucial fix unblocks our primary work on the learning scenarios and will prevent context-setting failures in all future sessions.
