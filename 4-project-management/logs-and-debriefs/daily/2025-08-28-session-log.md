# Session Log: August 28, 2025 - Repository Reorganization & Framework Creation

## Session Goal
The primary goal for this session was to reorganize the repository for better clarity and to establish a systematic framework for analyzing the external projects we have imported.

## Session Summary
We began the session with the intention of starting "Scenario 1: Requirements Discovery." However, we quickly identified that the repository's structure could be improved. We decided to pause the scenario work and focus on a full-scale reorganization.

### Key Activities:

1.  **Repository Reorganization:** We performed a comprehensive restructuring of the repository into a new, 4-part system (`1-source-material`, `2-learning-scenarios`, `3-learning-outputs`, `4-project-management`). This included re-integrating all external repositories as proper git submodules to ensure they can be easily updated.

2.  **Framework Proposal:** We discussed the need for a systematic way to analyze the Reuven Cohen projects. I proposed a three-phase analysis framework (Phase 1: High-Level Scoping, Phase 2: Deep Dive, Phase 3: Synthesis & Contribution).

3.  **Framework Implementation:** We decided on a hybrid approach to operationalize the framework. I created two new assets:
    *   A Markdown template (`project_analysis_template.md`) to serve as a checklist and documentation for each project analysis.
    *   A Python script (`3-new-analysis-starter.py`) to automate the creation of the necessary files and directories for each new analysis.

4.  **Documentation:** Upon your request, I added detailed usage instructions to the Python script to improve its clarity and usability.

5.  **Committing Changes:** All changes, including the reorganization, the new framework assets, and the script documentation, were committed and pushed to the `origin/main` branch.

## Outcome
The repository is now in a much more organized state, and we have a robust and repeatable framework for our future analysis work. We are now ready to begin the deep dive into the `CLAUDE-FLOW` project.
