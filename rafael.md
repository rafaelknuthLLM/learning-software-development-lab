### Chapter 1 – Building Data & AI Fluency inside a Global Life-Sciences Enterprise

Since 2020 I have been dedicated to one large enterprise in the life-sciences industry, helping its people make sense of data and artificial intelligence. I designed and ran a Data & AI Literacy programme that served roughly 1,000 commercial employees and achieved an average satisfaction score of 4.9/5. At the same time I advise senior leaders on how Generative and Agentic AI will reshape skills and workflows, and I am currently rolling out hands-on AI capabilities – from prompt design to specification-driven development – for a 600-person safety and environment team. Altogether these efforts have reached more than 2,000 professionals and raised the organisation's confidence in working with modern data tools.&#x20;

### Chapter 2 – Accelerating Digital Transformation in Tech & Cloud Services

Before concentrating on life-sciences, I helped large technology companies steer their digital change programmes. At T-Systems | Deutsche Telekom (2018-2019) I built training paths, led workshops and managed strategic vendor relationships. As Sales & Marketing lead for the E-Commerce Berlin EXPO (2015-2016) I created a multichannel lead-generation strategy that brought in headline exhibitors such as Alibaba and DHL. Earlier, I founded the OpenStack Online Meetup (2013-2015), growing it to 1,600 members and securing sponsorship from Dell, HP, Red Hat and others—experience that flowed into my work as Dell TechCenter's community manager, where I expanded a one-million-visitor enterprise forum to five countries.&#x20;

### Chapter 3 – Creative Roots and Continuous Learning

I began my career in advertising and finance, honing the storytelling skills that now underpin my technical work. As a copywriter for agencies serving Mercedes-Benz and McDonald's (1993-1999) I earned awards from the Art Directors Club, D&AD and The One Show. Later, as Marketing Director at Aquila Capital (2002-2005) I supported the company's growth from USD 50 m to USD 3 bn in assets, and I spent five years crafting digital campaigns for comdirect (2006-2011). In the following period I shifted gears toward building enterprise tech communities, drawing on the momentum of projects such as the OpenStack Online Meetup and Dell TechCenter. A self-funded learning sabbatical in 2017 then allowed me to dive deep into Power BI, Python and Azure ML—laying the groundwork for my present focus on Data & AI.&#x20;
