# Learning Software Development Through Real-World Discovery

I'm learning to code by exploring real-world open-source projects. I'm starting with the ecosystems of Anthropic and Reuven Cohen to learn how real software development works.

## How This Works

**My Approach:**
1. I completed Anthropic's courses (API, prompting, evaluations, tools)  
2. I explore the real code of modern technology leaders like Anthropic and Reuven Cohen
3. I practice software development skills by discovering how they actually build things
4. I document everything publicly and contribute back to the community

**Why This Works:** Real codebases teach you real skills. Artificial tutorials don't show you how companies actually work.

## What You'll Find

- **scenario-based-learning/** - My 6 learning scenarios based on software development phases
- **logs/daily/** - What I learned and built each day  
- **anthropic-courses/** - Anthropic's official training materials I studied
- **anthropic-cookbook/** - Examples and guides I'm exploring
- **config/** - Project configuration and Claude Code settings
- **scripts/** - Session management and automation tools

## My Learning Scenarios

I created 6 scenarios that follow software development phases:

1. **Requirements Discovery** - What problems does the code solve?
2. **Architecture Discovery** - How are the systems organized?  
3. **Implementation Discovery** - What coding practices are followed?
4. **Quality Discovery** - How is the code tested?
5. **Deployment Discovery** - How is software released?
6. **Maintenance Discovery** - How are systems kept running?

Each scenario: I study a course â†’ explore real code â†’ build tools â†’ share with community

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Just getting started!** Working on Scenario 1 (Requirements Discovery)

Check `logs/daily/` for my latest progress and `scenario-based-learning/scenarios_overview.md` for my full plan.

## Learning Principles

- Learn by doing real things, not tutorials
- Work in public and share discoveries  
- Contribute to the community early and often
- Document everything for others to follow
