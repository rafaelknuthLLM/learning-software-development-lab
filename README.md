# Learning Software Development Through Claude Code

A complete beginner's journey to mastering software development using Claude Code as infrastructure across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## About This Project

This learning laboratory documents my transition from data & AI literacy consultant in life sciences to proficient software developer. I'm following the "newbie on the team" methodology described by Cal Rueb from Anthropic, using Claude Code to explore, understand, and master software development patterns.

## Three-Dimensional Vision

ðŸŽ“ **Learning:** Master SDLC using Claude Code methodology  
ðŸš€ **Product:** Build GitHub analysis tool ("listen to what people BUILD")  
ðŸ’¼ **Business:** Expand consulting services with software development intelligence  

## Current Status

**Phase:** Discovery (learning absolute basics)  
**Timeline:** 3-6 months foundation, designed as ongoing learning engagement  
**Approach:** Hands-on exploration with structured documentation  

## Repository Structure

- `claude.md` - Comprehensive context for Claude Code sessions
- `learning-notes/` - Structured learning documentation  
- `practice-code/` - Hands-on coding exercises
- `code-specimens/` - Real code examples for analysis
- `discoveries/` - Notable patterns and insights

## Learning Philosophy

Starting with absolute basics (variables, functions, classes) using simple analogies, building vocabulary systematically, and documenting everything for future reference and community sharing.

## Future Vision

This laboratory will evolve into a comprehensive "Complete Beginner's Guide to Learning Software Development through Claude Code" - a resource for others making similar transitions.
