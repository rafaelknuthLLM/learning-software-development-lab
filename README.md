# Learning Software Development Through Real-World Discovery

I'm learning to code by pretending I'm a new team member at Anthropic. Instead of toy projects, I explore their actual codebase on GitHub to learn how real software development works.

## How This Works

**My Approach:**
1. I completed Anthropic's courses (API, prompting, evaluations, tools)  
2. I explore Anthropic's real code on GitHub like a new employee would
3. I practice software development skills by discovering how they actually build things
4. I document everything publicly and contribute back to the community

**Why This Works:** Real codebases teach you real skills. Artificial tutorials don't show you how companies actually work.

## What You'll Find

- **scenario-based-learning/** - My 6 learning scenarios based on software development phases
- **logs/daily/** - What I learned and built each day  
- **anthropic-courses/** - Anthropic's official training materials I studied
- **anthropic-cookbook/** - Examples and guides I'm exploring
- **config/** - Project configuration and Claude Code settings
- **scripts/** - Session management and automation tools

## My Learning Scenarios

I created 6 scenarios that follow software development phases:

1. **Requirements Discovery** - What problems does Anthropic's code solve?
2. **Architecture Discovery** - How do they organize their systems?  
3. **Implementation Discovery** - What coding practices do they follow?
4. **Quality Discovery** - How do they test their code?
5. **Deployment Discovery** - How do they release software?
6. **Maintenance Discovery** - How do they keep systems running?

Each scenario: I study their course â†’ explore their real code â†’ build tools â†’ share with community

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Just getting started!** Working on Scenario 1 (Requirements Discovery)

Check `logs/daily/` for my latest progress and `scenario-based-learning/scenarios_overview.md` for my full plan.

## Learning Principles

- Learn by doing real things, not tutorials
- Work in public and share discoveries  
- Contribute to the community early and often
- Document everything for others to follow
