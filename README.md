# Beginner's Learning Journey to Software Development

A hands-on learning repository documenting my journey from programming newbie to following industry best practices with SDLC and DevOps methodologies.

## What You'll Find Here
- Daily learning logs and discoveries
- Code examples and small projects
- Documentation of mistakes and lessons learned
- Resources and tutorials that helped me

**What This Repository Is:**
I'm learning software development by working through real SDLC scenarios. I copied Anthropic's courses to learn AI development, then I build working projects with Claude Code to practice each phase of the software development lifecycle.

**How It Works:**
- `courses/` = Official Anthropic training materials I study
- `scenario-based-learning/` = Where I build actual working code for each SDLC phase
- `daily-logs/` = What I learned and built each day
- Each scenario has working Jupyter notebooks with real code, not just theory

**Current Progress:**
âœ… **Scenario 1 Complete:** Requirements Analysis - Built working prompt engineering system with evaluation metrics
ðŸš§ **Next:** Design & Architecture scenario using real-world prompting techniques

## Learning Principles
1. Understand the big picture
2. Learn by building in public  
3. Contribute to the community
4. Document everything

## Current Status
ðŸš§ Just getting started! Check the `daily-log/` folder for my latest learning notes.
