## Architecture Principles

### 🎯 Design Philosophy
1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices with progressive enhancement
2. **Performance-Driven**: Sub-3-second load times and smooth 60fps interactions
3. **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into every component
4. **Offline-Capable**: Progressive Web App with service worker caching
5. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript, comprehensive testing, and clear patterns

### 🏛️ Architectural Patterns
- **Atomic Design**: Scalable component organization (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Pages)
- **Redux Pattern**: Predictable state management with unidirectional data flow
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI and business logic
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery at multiple levels
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox with mobile-first breakpoints

### 🚀 Key Technical Decisions

| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript | Developer productivity, type safety, ecosystem |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit | Predictable updates, debugging tools, middleware |
| **API Integration** | Open-Meteo (free tier) | No costs, good data quality, global coverage |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules + Design Tokens | Scoped styles, consistent theming, maintainability |
| **Testing** | Jest + React Testing Library | Component testing, accessibility, user behavior |
| **Performance** | Code splitting + Lazy loading | Fast initial load, progressive enhancement |

## Performance Targets

### Core Web Vitals
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100 milliseconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

### Application Metrics
- **Initial Bundle Size**: < 250KB gzipped
- **API Response Time**: < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB steady state

## Implementation Guidelines

### 🔧 Development Workflow
1. **Start with ADRs**: Document significant architectural decisions
2. **Component Design**: Follow atomic design principles
3. **State Management**: Use Redux for shared state, local state for UI concerns
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries
5. **Performance**: Monitor Core Web Vitals and optimize continuously

### 📱 Responsive Implementation
- **Mobile First**: Design and develop for mobile, enhance for larger screens
- **Breakpoints**: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px × 44px for interactive elements
- **Content Density**: Adjust information density based on screen size

### ♿ Accessibility Standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements and ARIA attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse/touch
- **Screen Readers**: Comprehensive labeling and live region updates
- **Visual Design**: High contrast ratios and scalable text

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
