We need to select a frontend framework for building a responsive weather forecast application that will be used on various devices and screen sizes.

### Decision
We will use **React** with TypeScript as the primary frontend framework.

### Rationale
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, debugging support, and extensive ecosystem
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and React 18 concurrent features provide good performance
- **Community Support**: Large community, extensive documentation, and third-party libraries
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration provides compile-time error checking
- **Mobile Support**: Can be easily extended to React Native for mobile apps
- **Team Expertise**: Team has strong React experience

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Fast development velocity due to team familiarity
- Excellent debugging and development tools
- Large ecosystem of reusable components
- Strong TypeScript support for maintainability
- Future mobile app development opportunities

**Negative**:
- Bundle size larger than vanilla JavaScript solutions
- Learning curve for junior developers new to React
- Runtime overhead compared to compiled frameworks

### Alternatives Considered
- **Vue.js**: Good performance but less team expertise
- **Svelte**: Smaller bundle size but limited ecosystem
- **Angular**: Too complex for a simple weather app
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lower performance and maintainability

## ADR-002: State Management Solution

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-16
**Decision Makers**: Development Team

### Context
The application needs to manage weather data, user preferences, search state, and UI state across multiple components. We need a predictable state management solution.

### Decision
We will use **Redux Toolkit** with **React-Redux** for state management.

### Rationale
- **Predictable State Updates**: Unidirectional data flow makes state changes predictable
- **Developer Experience**: Redux DevTools provide excellent debugging capabilities
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Can replay actions and inspect state changes
- **Middleware Support**: Thunk middleware for async operations, logging, analytics
- **Caching**: Easy to implement caching strategies within the store
- **Performance**: Selective subscriptions prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Centralized state management makes data flow clear
- Excellent debugging and testing capabilities
- Predictable state updates reduce bugs
- Easy to implement caching and persistence
- Good performance with proper selector usage

**Negative**:
- Initial boilerplate overhead
- Learning curve for developers new to Redux
- Can be overkill for very simple state management needs

### Alternatives Considered
- **React Context + useReducer**: Simpler but no dev tools or middleware
- **Zustand**: Lighter weight but less tooling
- **Jotai**: Atomic approach but newer and less proven
- **SWR/React Query**: Good for server state but not local UI state

## ADR-003: API Integration Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-17
**Decision Makers**: Development Team, Product Owner

### Context
We need to integrate with a weather API to fetch current conditions and forecasts. The solution should be reliable, cost-effective, and provide good data quality.

### Decision
We will use **Open-Meteo API** for weather data and geocoding services.

### Rationale
- **Cost**: Free for non-commercial use with no API key requirements
- **Rate Limits**: No strict rate limits for reasonable usage
- **Data Quality**: High-quality weather data from multiple sources
- **Coverage**: Global coverage with good accuracy
- **Performance**: Fast response times and reliable uptime
- **Documentation**: Well-documented API with clear endpoints
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Open-source weather data reduces dependency risk

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- No API costs or key management overhead
- Reliable service with good uptime
- High-quality weather data
- Simple integration without authentication
- Good performance and global coverage

**Negative**:
- Fair use policy may limit heavy commercial usage
- Less control over data sources compared to paid services
- Potential future changes to free tier availability

### Alternatives Considered
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Good API but requires paid plan for production
- **WeatherAPI**: Limited free tier with low request limits
- **AccuWeather**: Expensive and complex licensing
- **National Weather Service**: US-only coverage

## ADR-004: Caching Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-18
**Decision Makers**: Development Team

### Context
Weather data changes frequently but doesn't need to be real-time. We need a caching strategy that balances data freshness with performance and API usage.

### Decision
We will implement a **multi-level caching strategy** with different TTL values for different data types.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Reduces API calls and improves response times
- **Offline Support**: Cached data allows basic functionality offline
- **API Efficiency**: Respects API fair use policies
- **User Experience**: Instant results for recently searched locations
- **Battery Life**: Fewer network requests improve mobile battery usage

### Cache Levels
1. **Browser Cache**: HTTP cache headers for static assets (24 hours)
2. **Memory Cache**: In-app cache for current session (10 minutes for weather)
3. **LocalStorage**: Persistent cache for user preferences and recent searches
4. **Service Worker Cache**: Offline support with stale-while-revalidate

### TTL Strategy
- **Current Weather**: 10 minutes (weather changes gradually)
- **Forecasts**: 1 hour (daily forecasts are stable)
- **Geocoding**: 24 hours (location coordinates don't change)
- **Static Data**: 30 days (weather condition mappings, icons)

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Improved performance and user experience
- Reduced API usage and costs
- Better offline functionality
- Lower battery usage on mobile devices
- Graceful degradation during network issues

**Negative**:
- Complexity in cache invalidation logic
- Potential for stale data display
- Memory usage for cached data
- Cache consistency challenges

### Alternatives Considered
- **No Caching**: Simple but poor performance and API usage
- **Simple TTL**: Easier but less optimized for different data types
- **Server-Side Caching**: Would require backend infrastructure

## ADR-005: Error Handling Approach

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-19
**Decision Makers**: Development Team, UX Designer

### Context
The application needs to handle various types of errors gracefully, including network failures, API errors, invalid user input, and application errors. Users should receive helpful feedback and recovery options.

### Decision
We will implement a **layered error handling system** with global error boundaries, specific error handlers, and user-friendly error messages.

### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages help users resolve issues
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation prevents application crashes
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive error logging aids development and maintenance
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms improve reliability
- **Accessibility**: Error messages are screen reader friendly

### Error Handling Layers
1. **Global Error Boundary**: Catches unhandled React component errors
2. **Service Layer**: Handles API and network errors with classification
3. **Component Level**: Manages form validation and user input errors
4. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and inline error states

### Error Categories
- **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, offline status
- **API Errors**: 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid city names, empty inputs
- **Application Errors**: Component crashes, state corruption

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Improved user experience with helpful error messages
- Better application reliability and crash prevention
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation during service outages
- Clear recovery paths for users

**Negative**:
- Increased complexity in error handling code
- Additional testing requirements for error scenarios

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-20
**Decision Makers**: Development Team, UX Designer

### Context
The weather application will be used across various devices and screen sizes. We need a responsive design approach that provides optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Decision
We will use a **mobile-first responsive design** approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox, supported by a component-based design system.

### Rationale
- **Mobile Usage**: Majority of users access weather apps on mobile devices
- **Performance**: Mobile-first approach ensures fast loading on slower connections
