# 🎯 Software Architecture: Hands-On Exercises for Beginners

## Exercise 1: Identify the Architecture in Your Daily Apps 📱

### Instagram Architecture Detective 🔍

Think about Instagram and answer these questions:

**The House Questions:**
1. What are the main "rooms" (features)?
   - [ ] Photo feed
   - [ ] Stories
   - [ ] Direct messages
   - [ ] Reels
   - [ ] Profile pages
   - [ ] Search/Explore

2. How do these "rooms" connect?
   - When you post a photo, which other "rooms" get updated?
   - When someone likes your photo, what happens in other parts?

**Your Analysis:**
```
Write your observations here:

Instagram uses **microservices architecture**:
- **Photo Service**: Stores and serves images
- **Feed Service**: Decides what photos you see
- **Notification Service**: Tells you about likes/comments
- **Story Service**: Handles 24-hour content
- **Message Service**: Private conversations

They all connect through APIs, like doors between rooms!

- Order history? _____________________

### Draw Your Architecture:
```
Draw your pizza app architecture here using simple shapes:

[Customer App]
      |
      ↓
[Your design here]

## Exercise 3: The Airport Analogy Game ✈️

### Match the Airport Part to Software Architecture:

Draw lines to connect the airport component to its software equivalent:

**Airport Component:**
1. Check-in Counter
2. Security Checkpoint  
3. Baggage System
4. Flight Schedule Board
5. Air Traffic Control
6. Passenger Tickets
7. Airport Lounges
8. Runway

**Software Component:**
- A. Database (stores all the data)
- B. Authentication (security check)
- C. User Interface (where users start)
- D. API Gateway (controls traffic)
- E. Message Queue (organizes flow)
- F. Display/Dashboard (shows status)
- G. Session Tokens (user identification)
- H. Cache (temporary waiting area)

### Answers:
<details>
<summary>Click to reveal matches</summary>

1. Check-in Counter → C (User Interface)
2. Security Checkpoint → B (Authentication)
3. Baggage System → A (Database)
4. Flight Schedule Board → F (Display/Dashboard)
5. Air Traffic Control → D (API Gateway)
6. Passenger Tickets → G (Session Tokens)
7. Airport Lounges → H (Cache)
8. Runway → E (Message Queue)

## Exercise 4: Spot the Architecture Pattern 🔍

### Look at these scenarios and identify which architecture pattern fits best:

**Scenario 1:** 
"A small blog website where everything - articles, comments, and user profiles - are all in one application."

Pattern: _____________________

**Scenario 2:**
"Netflix, where the video player, recommendations, user profiles, and payment processing all work independently."

Pattern: _____________________

**Scenario 3:**
"Your banking app, where security is checked at every level - login, viewing balance, making transfers."

Pattern: _____________________

### Answers:
<details>

## Exercise 5: Build a Virtual Restaurant 🍽️

### Your Mission:
Design the architecture for a restaurant system using what you've learned.

### Requirements:
- Customers can view menu

- Inventory is tracked

### Fill in the Architecture:

**What are your main components?**
1. _____________________
2. _____________________
3. _____________________
4. _____________________
5. _____________________

**How do they communicate?**
- Customer to Waiter: _____________________
- Waiter to Kitchen: _____________________
- Kitchen to Inventory: _____________________

**What needs to be stored?**
- _____________________
- _____________________
- _____________________

## Exercise 6: The "What Could Go Wrong?" Game 🚨

### For each architecture decision, identify what could go wrong:

**Decision 1:** "Let's put everything in one big program"
- Risk: _____________________

**Decision 2:** "Let's split everything into 100 tiny services"
- Risk: _____________________

**Decision 3:** "We don't need to save any data"
- Risk: _____________________

**Decision 4:** "Every part should talk to every other part directly"
- Risk: _____________________

### Answers:
<details>

1. **Single point of failure** - If it breaks, everything breaks
2. **Too complex to manage** - Like juggling 100 balls
3. **No memory** - System forgets everything
4. **Spaghetti connections** - Impossible to track or fix

"We lost all customer data when the server crashed"
- Likely issue: _____________________
- Solution: _____________________

### Answers:
<details>
<summary>Click for solutions</summary>

1. **No scalability** → Add load balancing or better infrastructure
2. **Too tightly coupled** → Separate into independent services
3. **No backup system** → Add database replication and backups
