# Learning Software Development Through Claude Code - Complete Beginner's Laboratory

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is my comprehensive **learning laboratory** for mastering software development using Claude Code as infrastructure across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I'm transitioning from a data & AI literacy consultant in life sciences to becoming proficient in software development through hands-on exploration and structured learning.

## CONTEXT FILES - ESSENTIAL READING FOR CLAUDE

**Learning Persona Alignment:** Perfect match with Legal Team Non-Developer from Anthropic's context - non-technical professional building technical capabilities to expand consulting services and solve real business problems.

### About Anthropic Team Usage (context.md)
**10 Team Perspectives on Claude Code Usage:** Comprehensive guide showing how different Anthropic teams (Data Infrastructure, Product Development, Security Engineering, Inference, Data Science, API, Growth Marketing, Product Design, RL Engineering, Legal) use Claude Code to transform workflows, bridge skill gaps, and achieve unprecedented productivity gains.

**Key Insights for Learning:**
- **Legal team success pattern:** Complete beginners built accessibility tools, workflow automation, and prototypes in hours/days using visual-first, step-by-step approaches
- **Common patterns across teams:** Project-based learning, agentic tool mastery, systematic codebase exploration, iterative development with frequent checkpoints
- **Real-world applications:** Teams solved complex problems without traditional development expertise, using Claude Code as infrastructure for tasks previously requiring specialized engineering resources

**Learning Methodology Validation:** Multiple teams demonstrate that non-developers can successfully build functional software using Claude Code's systematic exploration tools (glob, grep, git) and project-based learning approaches.

## THREE-DIMENSIONAL VISION

### üéì LEARNING PERSPECTIVE
**Goal:** Master software development fundamentals through Claude Code methodology

## IMMEDIATE LEARNING GOALS - PROJECT-BASED DISCOVERY METHODOLOGY (Next 30 Days)

### Learning Philosophy: Real Codebases Over Theory
**Core Approach:** Learn programming fundamentals through systematic analysis of real GitHub projects, progressing from simple to complex codebases while building practical software development skills through hands-on exploration.

**Target Outcome:** Analyze 5-50 GitHub projects in 4 weeks, gaining genuine software development experience rather than theoretical knowledge.

### METHODOLOGY: Four-Pillar Project Analysis Framework

#### Learning Loop Structure
Each project follows this systematic analysis pattern:
1. **Select Project** - Choose based on complexity progression and learning persona
2. **Four-Pillar Deep Dive** - Systematic exploration using agentic tools
3. **Document Insights** - Capture patterns, vocabulary, and discoveries
4. **Progress to Next** - Select more complex project based on newfound confidence

#### The Four Pillars Applied to Each Project

**PILLAR 1: Foundation Setting** (Week 1 Focus)
- **Goal:** Understand basic programming concepts within real working code
- **Method:** Use agentic search (glob, grep) to find variables, functions, classes in actual projects
- **Questions:** What are variables called in this project? How are functions organized? What do classes actually do here?
- **Output:** Build vocabulary through real code examples, not abstract definitions

**PILLAR 2: Exploration Tools** (Week 2 Focus) 
- **Goal:** Master systematic codebase navigation using Claude Code's agentic tools
- **Method:** Practice glob patterns, grep searches, file exploration on each project
- **Questions:** How do I find all Python files? How do I search for specific function calls? What patterns emerge when I explore systematically?
- **Output:** Develop "experienced developer" navigation skills through repetition across multiple codebases

**PILLAR 3: GitHub Discovery** (Week 3 Focus)
- **Goal:** Understand project history, collaboration patterns, and Git workflows
- **Method:** Explore commit history, README files, issue tracking, pull requests
- **Questions:** How did this project evolve? What collaboration patterns exist? How do contributors work together?
- **Output:** Understand software development as collaborative, iterative process

**PILLAR 4: Pattern Recognition** (Week 4 Focus)
- **Goal:** Identify recurring themes and best practices across analyzed projects
- **Method:** Compare organizational structures, naming conventions, architectural decisions across projects
- **Questions:** What patterns repeat across different projects? Why do successful projects share certain structures? What makes code "professional"?
- **Output:** Begin developing intuition for software quality and best practices

### DETAILED LEARNING WORKFLOW FOR EACH PROJECT

#### CRITICAL: Top-Down Exploration Methodology
**Rafael's Learning Style:** Always start with the big picture first, then drill down into details
**Approach:** Bird's-eye view ‚Üí Structure understanding ‚Üí Folder exploration ‚Üí Code analysis

#### Step 1: Project Selection and Setup
1. **Choose project** based on current week's focus and complexity level
2. **Clone or access** project using Claude Code's repository tools

#### Step 2: Top-Down Repository Exploration (MANDATORY SEQUENCE)

**2a. README Analysis First**
- Read README.md completely to understand:
  - What the project does (purpose and goals)
  - Why it exists (problem it solves)
  - How to use it (basic usage)
  - Target audience and scope
- Document key insights and questions raised

**2b. Repository Structure Overview**  
- Use `LS` tool to map overall folder structure
- Identify main organizational patterns:
  - What are the major folders/directories?
  - How is content organized logically?
  - What file types are present (extensions)?
- Create mental model of project architecture

**2c. Folder-by-Folder Exploration**
- Explore each major folder systematically:
  - What's the purpose of each directory?
  - What types of files live in each folder?
  - How do folders relate to each other?
- Use `LS` and `Glob` tools to understand content without diving into code

**2d. File Pattern Recognition**
- Identify common file types and naming patterns
- Understand configuration files, documentation, data files
- Spot the main executable/entry point files
- Note any special files (requirements.txt, .gitignore, etc.)

**2e. ONLY THEN: Code Analysis**
- Select representative files based on folder exploration
- Start with simpler utility files before complex implementations
- Use context from README and structure to understand code purpose

#### Step 3: Four-Pillar Systematic Analysis
**Execute each pillar methodically, documenting discoveries:**

**Foundation Setting Questions:**
- Where are the variables defined and how are they named?
- What functions exist and how are they organized?
- Are there classes? What do they represent in this context?
- How does this project solve a real-world problem?

**Exploration Tools Practice:**
- Use `glob` to find all files of different types
- Use `grep` to search for specific patterns, function calls, imports
- Practice navigating file structure systematically
- Time myself getting oriented in unfamiliar codebase

**GitHub Discovery Investigation:**
- Examine commit history - how did the project evolve?
- Read through issues and pull requests - what problems were solved?
- Understand contributor patterns and collaboration workflows
- Identify project milestones and major changes

**Pattern Recognition Documentation:**
- How is this project organized compared to previous ones?
- What naming conventions and coding styles are used?
- What architectural decisions were made and why?
- How does this project demonstrate software development best practices?

#### Step 3: Learning Documentation
**For each project analyzed, create structured documentation:**
1. **Project Summary** - What it does, why it exists, key technologies
2. **Vocabulary Gained** - New programming terms learned in context
3. **Patterns Discovered** - Organizational, naming, architectural insights
4. **Questions Raised** - Things to explore in future projects
5. **Confidence Level** - Rate comfort with project complexity

#### Step 4: Progress Assessment and Next Project Selection
1. **Reflect on learning** - What clicked? What confused me?
2. **Update overall pattern library** - How do insights connect?
3. **Select next project** - Based on gaps identified and confidence gained
4. **Adjust complexity** - Challenge myself appropriately
