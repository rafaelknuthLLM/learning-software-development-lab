# Learning Software Development Lab

## Project Overview
Complete beginner learning software development using SDLC methodology and Claude Code best practices. Transitioning from data/AI consultant to software developer through hands-on exploration and contributing to Anthropic's community.

## Commands
- No specific build commands yet (learning phase)
- Commit frequently: `git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push`

## Learning Approach
- Learn by building and contributing to Anthropic's community
- Prioritize velocity over perfection - ship early, iterate fast
- Learn just enough to make the next step forward
- Learn in the open - document and share discoveries
- Always use top-down methodology: README → Structure → Folders → Code
- Start with big picture before diving into details
- Use agentic tools (glob, grep) for systematic exploration
- Document my discoveries in scenario-based-learning/

## Code Style Preferences
- Simple, readable code over complex solutions
- Extensive comments and explanations for learning
- Real-world analogies for technical concepts

## File Organization
- claude.md: My instructions for Claude Code (this file)
- context.md: Anthropic's team usage patterns for Claude Code
- scenario-based-learning/: My hands-on SDLC exercises with Claude Code
- daily-logs/: My session summaries and discoveries
- requirements.txt: My Python dependencies for Jupyter notebooks
- session_starter.py: My script to load project context at start of each session

## Current Focus
Build-first learning: Create functional prototypes while learning through observation.
Goal: Build tools and insights that benefit Anthropic's developer community.
Current: My scenario-based learning using Anthropic's courses - Requirements Analysis with Prompt Engineering (my Scenario 1 complete).
