# Learning Software Development Lab

## Project Overview
Complete beginner learning software development using SDLC methodology and Claude Code best practices. Transitioning from data/AI consultant to software developer through hands-on exploration and contributing to Anthropic's community.

## Commands
- No specific build commands yet (learning phase)
- Commit frequently: `git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push`

## Learning Approach
- Learn by building and contributing to Anthropic's community
- Prioritize velocity over perfection - ship early, iterate fast
- Learn just enough to make the next step forward
- Learn in the open - document and share discoveries
- Always use top-down methodology: README → Structure → Folders → Code
- Start with big picture before diving into details
- Use agentic tools (glob, grep) for systematic exploration
- Document discoveries in learning-notes/
- Update dictionary.md with new programming terms

## Code Style Preferences
- Simple, readable code over complex solutions
- Extensive comments and explanations for learning
- Real-world analogies for technical concepts

## File Organization
- claude.md: Instructions for Claude Code (this file)
- rafael.md: Professional context
- context.md: Anthropic team usage patterns
- dictionary.md: Programming vocabulary with analogies
- learning-notes/: Structured project analysis
- daily-logs/: Session summaries

## Current Focus
Build-first learning: Create functional prototypes while learning through observation.
Goal: Build tools and insights that benefit Anthropic's developer community.
Next: Systematic analysis of Anthropic Cookbook using four-pillar methodology.
