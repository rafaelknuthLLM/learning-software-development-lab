# Learning Software Development Through Claude Code - Complete Beginner's Laboratory

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is my comprehensive **learning laboratory** for mastering software development using Claude Code as infrastructure across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I'm transitioning from a data & AI literacy consultant in life sciences to becoming proficient in software development through hands-on exploration and structured learning.

## IMMEDIATE LEARNING GOALS - PROJECT-BASED DISCOVERY METHODOLOGY (Next 30 Days)

### Learning Philosophy: Real Codebases Over Theory
**Core Approach:** Learn programming fundamentals through systematic analysis of real GitHub projects, progressing from simple to complex codebases while building practical software development skills through hands-on exploration.

**Target Outcome:** Analyze 5-50 GitHub projects in 4 weeks, gaining genuine software development experience rather than theoretical knowledge.

### METHODOLOGY: Four-Pillar Project Analysis Framework

#### Learning Loop Structure
Each project follows this systematic analysis pattern:
1. **Select Project** - Choose based on complexity progression and learning persona
2. **Four-Pillar Deep Dive** - Systematic exploration using agentic tools
3. **Document Insights** - Capture patterns, vocabulary, and discoveries
4. **Progress to Next** - Select more complex project based on newfound confidence

#### The Four Pillars Applied to Each Project

**PILLAR 1: Foundation Setting** (Week 1 Focus)
- **Goal:** Understand basic programming concepts within real working code
- **Method:** Use agentic search (glob, grep) to find variables, functions, classes in actual projects
- **Questions:** What are variables called in this project? How are functions organized? What do classes actually do here?
- **Output:** Build vocabulary through real code examples, not abstract definitions

**PILLAR 2: Exploration Tools** (Week 2 Focus) 
- **Goal:** Master systematic codebase navigation using Claude Code's agentic tools
- **Method:** Practice glob patterns, grep searches, file exploration on each project
- **Questions:** How do I find all Python files? How do I search for specific function calls? What patterns emerge when I explore systematically?
- **Output:** Develop "experienced developer" navigation skills through repetition across multiple codebases

**PILLAR 3: GitHub Discovery** (Week 3 Focus)
- **Goal:** Understand project history, collaboration patterns, and Git workflows
- **Method:** Explore commit history, README files, issue tracking, pull requests
- **Questions:** How did this project evolve? What collaboration patterns exist? How do contributors work together?
- **Output:** Understand software development as collaborative, iterative process

**PILLAR 4: Pattern Recognition** (Week 4 Focus)
- **Goal:** Identify recurring themes and best practices across analyzed projects
- **Method:** Compare organizational structures, naming conventions, architectural decisions across projects
- **Questions:** What patterns repeat across different projects? Why do successful projects share certain structures? What makes code "professional"?
- **Output:** Begin developing intuition for software quality and best practices

### PROJECT SELECTION STRATEGY

#### Starting Persona: Legal Team Non-Developer
**Why:** Complete beginners who successfully built functional tools using visual-first, step-by-step approaches
**Learning Style:** Incremental, practical, focused on solving real problems
**Success Pattern:** Built accessibility tools, workflow automation, and prototypes in hours/days

#### Project Progression Path
**Week 1-2: Simple Projects** (Foundation + Exploration)
- Start with Anthropic-related simple tools, accessibility projects, basic workflow scripts
- Focus on projects with clear README files and straightforward structure
- Analyze 3-5 simple projects to build confidence and vocabulary

**Week 3: Intermediate Projects** (GitHub Discovery)
- Move to slightly more complex Anthropic ecosystem projects
- Explore projects with multiple contributors, clear Git history
- Analyze 2-3 projects with active development and good documentation

**Week 4: Complex Projects** (Pattern Recognition) 
- Examine larger, well-structured projects from Anthropic or related companies
- Focus on projects that demonstrate professional development patterns
- Analyze 1-2 comprehensive projects to understand larger system architecture

### DETAILED LEARNING WORKFLOW FOR EACH PROJECT

#### Step 1: Project Selection and Setup
1. **Choose project** based on current week's focus and complexity level
2. **Clone or access** project using Claude Code's repository tools
3. **Initial overview** - README, structure, main files identification
4. **Set expectations** - What should I learn from this specific project?

#### Step 2: Four-Pillar Systematic Analysis
**Execute each pillar methodically, documenting discoveries:**

**Foundation Setting Questions:**
- Where are the variables defined and how are they named?
- What functions exist and how are they organized?
- Are there classes? What do they represent in this context?
- How does this project solve a real-world problem?

**Exploration Tools Practice:**
- Use `glob` to find all files of different types
- Use `grep` to search for specific patterns, function calls, imports
- Practice navigating file structure systematically
- Time myself getting oriented in unfamiliar codebase

**GitHub Discovery Investigation:**
- Examine commit history - how did the project evolve?
- Read through issues and pull requests - what problems were solved?
- Understand contributor patterns and collaboration workflows
- Identify project milestones and major changes

**Pattern Recognition Documentation:**
- How is this project organized compared to previous ones?
- What naming conventions and coding styles are used?
- What architectural decisions were made and why?
- How does this project demonstrate software development best practices?

#### Step 3: Learning Documentation
**For each project analyzed, create structured documentation:**
1. **Project Summary** - What it does, why it exists, key technologies
2. **Vocabulary Gained** - New programming terms learned in context
3. **Patterns Discovered** - Organizational, naming, architectural insights
4. **Questions Raised** - Things to explore in future projects
5. **Confidence Level** - Rate comfort with project complexity

#### Step 4: Progress Assessment and Next Project Selection
1. **Reflect on learning** - What clicked? What confused me?
2. **Update overall pattern library** - How do insights connect?
3. **Select next project** - Based on gaps identified and confidence gained
4. **Adjust complexity** - Challenge myself appropriately
