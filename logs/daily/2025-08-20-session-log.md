## Session Focus
Scenario 1 Deep Dive - Business Intelligence Analysis of Developer Onboarding Patterns

## Objectives
- Deep dive into Scenario 1 findings rather than rushing to Scenario 2
- Apply business intelligence lens to the 46% developer onboarding pattern discovered
- Formulate testable hypotheses about enterprise skill gaps using GitHub data
- Apply rigorous data science methodology to validate business assumptions for Enterprise Literacy & Upskilling Programs

## Context
Building on Scenario 1 completion (Requirements Discovery through Ecosystem Analysis), we're taking time to thoroughly analyze the patterns discovered, specifically the finding that 46% of Anthropic's ecosystem addresses developer onboarding challenges.

## Session Plan
### Phase 1: Business Context & Hypothesis Formation
- [ ] Map current enterprise training business assumptions
- [ ] Identify GitHub data validation opportunities from Scenario 1 findings
- [ ] Formulate specific, testable hypotheses about developer onboarding patterns
- [ ] Define success metrics for each hypothesis

### Phase 2: Methodology Design  
- [ ] Design data collection strategy from existing Scenario 1 analysis
- [ ] Plan statistical analysis framework for rigorous validation
- [ ] Create validation methodology for business insights
- [ ] Establish bias mitigation strategies

### Phase 3: Analysis Execution
- [ ] Extract relevant data from Scenario 1 ecosystem categorization
- [ ] Apply statistical rigor to validate/reject business hypotheses  
- [ ] Quantify enterprise training opportunities with confidence intervals
- [ ] Document actionable insights for training programs
